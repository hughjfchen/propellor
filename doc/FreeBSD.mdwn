Propellor is in the early stages of supporting FreeBSD. It should basically
work, and there are some modules with FreeBSD-specific properties. 

However, many other properties only work on a Debian Linux system, and need
additional porting to support FreeBSD. Such properties have types like 
`Property DebianLike`. The type checker will detect and reject attempts
to combine such properties with `Property FreeBSD`.

[Sample config file](http://git.joeyh.name/?p=propellor.git;a=blob;f=config-freebsd.hs)
which configures a FreeBSD system, as well as a Linux one.
