propellor 5.15 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""  * Improve propellor's MetaTypes implementation to avoid an expontential
    blowup when several MetaTypes fail to unify. This should result in less
    memory use by ghc when there's a type error.
  * Avoid OOM when built by ghc 9.2.
  * Thanks to the ghc developers for their assistance, particularly spj
    and Sam Derbyshire.
  * Remove workaround to ghc using a lot of memory displaying an error
    message about a property of a host having the wrong number of
    arguments. This brings back clear error messages in such situations."""]]
